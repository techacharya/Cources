# Introduction to Unix-like System

A Unix-like system is an operating system that behaves in a manner similar to a Unix system, although not necessarily conforming to or being certified to any version of the single Unix specification.

## History of Unix
In the mid **`1960s`**, when the **Massachusetts Institute of Technology**, **AT&T Bell Labs**, and **General Electric** were jointly developing an experimental time-sharing operating system called **Multiplexed Information and Computing Service** ( **`Multics`** ) allowing multiple users to access a mainframe simultaneously. Multics introduced many innovations, but also had many problems.

**Bell Labs**, got frustrated by the size and complexity of **`Multics`** and dissatisfied with the project's progress, hence ultimately management withdrew.
