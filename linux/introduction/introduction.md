# Introduction to Unix-like System

A Unix-like system is an operating system that behaves in a manner similar to a Unix system, although not necessarily conforming to or being certified to any version of the single Unix specification.

## History of Unix
In the mid **`1960s`**, when the **Massachusetts Institute of Technology**, **AT&T Bell Labs**, and **General Electric** were jointly developing an experimental time-sharing operating system called **Multiplexed Information and Computing Service** ( **`Multics`** ) allowing multiple users to access a mainframe simultaneously. Multics introduced many innovations, but also had many problems.

**Bell Labs**, got frustrated by the size and complexity of **`Multics`** and dissatisfied with the project's progress, hence ultimately management withdrew.

Their researchers **Ken Thompson**, **Dennis Ritchie**, **Doug McIlroy**, **Brian Kernighan** and **Joe Ossanna** decided to redo the work and in **`in 1969`** launched the **`Unix`** which was much smaller and simpler than **`Multics`**.

In **1973**, Version 4 **Unix** was rewritten in the **`higher-level language C`** but still had considerable assembly **PDP-11** dependent code , **AT&T** released Version 5 Unix and licensed it to educational institutions, and licensed **1975's** Version 6 to companies for the first time.

In **1983** the **Unix** kernel were written in almost all in **higher-level language C** in less than **20,000** lines of code and more than 75% was not machine-dependent. By that year **Unix** or a **Unix-like** system was available for at least **16** different processors and architectures from about 60 vendors.
