# Introduction to Unix-like System

A Unix-like system is an operating system that behaves in a manner similar to a Unix system, although not necessarily conforming to or being certified to any version of the single Unix specification.

## History of Unix
In the mid **`1960s`**, when the ${\color{purple}Massachusetts Institute of Technology}$ , ${\color{purple}AT&T Bell Labs}$ , and ${\color{purple}General Electric}$ were jointly developing an experimental time-sharing operating system called Multiplexed Information and Computing Service **`Multics`**. Multics introduced many innovations, but also had many problems.
