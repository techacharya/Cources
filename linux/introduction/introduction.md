# Introduction to Unix-like System

A Unix-like system is an operating system that behaves in a manner similar to a Unix system, although not necessarily conforming to or being certified to any version of the single Unix specification.

## History of Unix
  - In the mid **`1960s`**, when the **Massachusetts Institute of Technology**, **AT&T Bell Labs**, and **General Electric** were jointly developing an experimental time-sharing operating system called **Multiplexed Information and Computing Service** ( **`Multics`** ) allowing multiple users to access a mainframe simultaneously. Multics introduced many innovations, but also had many problems.

  - **Bell Labs**, got frustrated by the size and complexity of **`Multics`** and dissatisfied with the project's progress, hence ultimately management withdrew.

  - Their researchers **Ken Thompson**, **Dennis Ritchie**, **Doug McIlroy**, **Brian Kernighan** and **Joe Ossanna** decided to redo the work and in **`in 1969`** launched the **`Unix`** which was much smaller and simpler than **`Multics`**.

  - In **1973**, Version 4 **Unix** was rewritten in the **`higher-level language C`** to make it portable but still had considerable assembly **PDP-11** dependent code , **AT&T** released Version 5 Unix and licensed it to educational institutions, and licensed **1975's** Version 6 to companies for the first time.

  - The availability and portability of **Unix** caused it to be widely adopted, copied and modified by academic institutions and businesses.

  - In **1977**, the **`Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)`** was developed by the **Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG)** from UC Berkeley, based on the **`6th`** edition of **Unix** from **AT&T**. Since **BSD** contained **Unix** code that **AT&T** owned, **AT&T** filed a lawsuit against the **University of California**. This strongly limited the development and adoption of **BSD**.

  - In **1983** the **Unix** kernel were rewritten in almost all in **higher-level language C** in less than **20,000** lines of code and more than 75% was not machine-dependent. By that year **Unix** or a **Unix-like** system was available for at least **16** different processors and architectures from about 60 vendors.

  - In **1983**, only **Richard Stallman** started the **`GNU project`** with the goal of creating a free **Unix-like** operating system. And he wrote the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**. By the early **1990s**, there was almost enough available software to create a full Operating System. However, the GNU kernel, called **Hurd**, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving **GNU** incomplete.

  - In **1987**, **`MINIX`**, a Unix-like system for academic use was released by **Andrew S. Tanenbaum** to exemplify the principles conveyed in his textbook, **Operating Systems: Design and Implementation**.

 

## History of Linux
  - In **1991**, a computer science student at **`University of Helsinki`**, **Linus Torvalds** began writting the code specifically for his own hardware, he was using and independent of an Operating System because he wanted to use the functions of his new **PC** with an **`80386 processor`**. He has written the code on **`MINIX`** using the **GNU C Compiler** that later became the **Linux kernel**.

  - **Torvalds** first published the **`Linux kernel`** under its own licence, which had a restriction on commercial activity. In **1992**, he released the **kernel** under the GNU General Public License. 
  - The software to use with the **kernel** was developed by the **GNU project** licensed under the **`GNU General Public License`**, a free software license.

  - Linux began to gain importance in **1992** after the **`X Window System`** was ported to Linux by **Orest Zborowski**, which allowed Linux to support a **GUI** for the first time.
