# File Permissions in linux Systems

Linux is the **_multi-user_** operating system which can be accessed by many users simultaneously. But this raises security concerns as an unsolicited or malign user can corrupt, change or remove crucial data. For effective security, linux divides authorization into two levels.
  1. **_Ownership_**
  2. **_Permission_**

#### File and Directory Ownership
Each and every file/directory is owned by a specific user or UID and a specific group or GID.
