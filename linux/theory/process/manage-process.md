# Process Management and Monitoring in `linux` System
A process is basically a program in the execution. _For example:_ Suppose we have a **_C language_** program file _**` welcome.c `**_ and this program file will be given to the **_C language Compiler_** like _**` gcc `**_. Compiler will just convert this **_high level language_** (source code) to **_low level language_** (machine code) that is a binary code or file, which is directly executes on the hardware and provides the appropriate result.
