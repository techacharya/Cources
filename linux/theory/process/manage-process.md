# Process Management and Monitoring in `linux` System
A process is basically a program in the execution. _For example:_ Suppose we have a **_C language_** program file _**` welcome.c `**_ and this program file will be given to the **_C language Compiler_** like _**` gcc `**_. Compiler will just convert this **_high level language_** (source code) to **_low level language_** (machine code) that is a binary code or file, which is directly executes on the hardware and provides the appropriate result.

These binary files or codes called program and generally reside in the secondary storage device i.e., **_HDD/SSD_**. In order to exeute this program Operating system loads this program into the **_main memory_** i.e., **_RAM_** and starts executing it. When program loads into **_main memory_** it creates data structures into the **_RAM_** and this structure is called as process.
