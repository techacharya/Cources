# Accessing the linux Command-line Terminal

Once we have done with the linux based operating system installation the next step is to access the linux command-line terminal. The power of linux system actually lies in it's command-line mode. Graphical User Interface is very simple to learn and use. There are two different method by which command-line can be accessed:
  - Text mode
  - GUI mode

If you're at the physical console or in the case of a **_Virtual Machine_**, the virtual console, you'll either get a login prompt if the system set defaults to the **` multi-user.target `** or a nice GNOME login window if it set defaults to the **` graphical.target `**.
