# Local User and Group Management

The control of _users_ and _groups_ is a core element of linux system administration. This chapter explains:
  - **_add_**
  - **_manage and_**
  - **_delete users and groups_**
  - **_creating group directories_**.

### Users
**_Users_** can be either people i.e., accounts tied to physical users or accounts that exist for specific applications to use. Hence, in linux system there are two types of user:
  - **Physical User**
    - **_Superuser or root_**
    - **_Regular User_**
  - **Service User**

### Groups
**_Groups_** are logical expressions of organization, tying users together for a common purpose. Users within a group share the same permissions to _read_, _write_, or _execute_ files owned by that group.
